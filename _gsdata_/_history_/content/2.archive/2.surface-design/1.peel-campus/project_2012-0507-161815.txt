Architects Taylor Robinson required a surface  
graphic to feature on the foyer reception wall. Taking inspiration from the surrounding native vegetation and natural environment, first with photographic studies - then illustrated versions of banksia and eucalyptus experimenting with line, form, texture and view points. A series of concepts were presented within  
the irregular designated wall panel areas. Design elements within each concept connecting adjoining panels and overall design.

The final surface design was digitally printed on  
8mm MDF board then inserted into the irregular  
interior wall fixtures.
