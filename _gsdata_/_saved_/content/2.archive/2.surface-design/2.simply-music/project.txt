Simply Music uses a revolutionary method in piano and keyboard teaching. Unlike the conventional process in which students learn to read and write music before they play, this method relies on the same way small children learn to talk – using our natural rhythmic instincts and attuning ourselves to the music by ‘feeling it' and ‘seeing it’. Therefore a series of expressive marks were developed in ink, pencil, crayons and paint to create compositions that had a musical feel and symbolised the teaching method.
